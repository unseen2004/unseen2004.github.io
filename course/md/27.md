# Chapter 27: Virtual Functions

## Introduction

A **virtual function** is a special type of member function that, when called, resolves to the most-derived version of the function for the actual type of the object being referenced or pointed to. This enables **runtime polymorphism**, allowing derived classes to override base class functions.

### Basic Example

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "Base"; } // note addition of virtual keyword
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "Derived"; }
};

int main()
{
    Derived derived {};
    Base& rBase{ derived };
    std::cout << "rBase is a " << rBase.getName() << '\n'; // rbase is a Derived
}
```

## Polymorphism

- **Compile-time polymorphism**: Resolved by the compiler (e.g., function overloads, templates).
- **Runtime polymorphism**: Resolved at runtime (e.g., virtual functions).

### Using `override`

Using the `override` specifier ensures that the function is indeed overriding a base class function.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "A"; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    std::string_view getName() const override { return "B"; } // Correct override
};
```

### Using `final`

The `final` specifier prevents further overriding of a virtual function or inheritance from a class.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "A"; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    std::string_view getName() const override final { return "B"; } // Cannot be overridden further
};

class C : public B {
public:
    std::string_view getName() const override { return "C"; } // Compile error: B::getName() is final
};
```

### Virtual Destructors

Whenever you are dealing with inheritance, you should make any explicit destructors virtual.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = default; // Virtual destructor
};
```

## Pure Virtual Functions

A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function that is declared by using the `= 0` syntax. Classes with pure virtual functions become abstract base classes and cannot be instantiated.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual std::string_view speak() const = 0; // pure virtual function
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    std::string_view speak() const override { return "Woof"; }
};
```

### Defining Pure Virtual Functions

Pure virtual functions can still have a definition.

```cpp
std::string_view Animal::speak() const
{
    return "buzz";
}
```

## Interface Classes

An **interface class** is a class that has no member variables, and all of its functions are pure virtual.

```cpp
class Interface {
public:
    virtual void func1() = 0;
    virtual void func2() = 0;
};
```

## Virtual Inheritance

To share a base class in multiple inheritance, use virtual inheritance.

```cpp
class PoweredDevice {};
class Scanner : virtual public PoweredDevice {};
class Printer : virtual public PoweredDevice {};
class Copier : public Scanner, public Printer {};
```

## Downcasting with `dynamic_cast`

If a `dynamic_cast` fails, the result of the conversion will be a null pointer.

```cpp
Base* b = new Derived();
Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b); // use dynamic cast to convert Base pointer into Derived pointer
```

Note that there are several cases where downcasting using `dynamic_cast` will not work:
1. With protected or private inheritance.
2. For classes that do not declare or inherit any virtual functions.
3. In certain cases involving virtual base classes.

## Using `static_cast`

```cpp
if (b->getClassID() == ClassID::derived)
{
    Derived* d{ static_cast<Derived*>(b) }; // safe downcast
}
```

## Virtual Table (vtable)

- Any class that uses virtual functions has a `__vptr`, and thus each object of that class will be bigger by one pointer.
- The **virtual table** is a lookup table of functions used to resolve function calls in a dynamic/late binding manner.

## Operator Overloading and Virtual Functions

```cpp
friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
{
    // Delegate printing responsibility for printing to virtual member function print()
    return b.print(out);
}

// We'll rely on member function print() to do the actual printing
// Because print() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
virtual std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const
{
    out << "Base";
    return out;
}
```

## Conclusion

Virtual functions enable **runtime polymorphism**, allowing derived classes to override base class functions. Understanding how to use `virtual`, `override`, `final`, and pure virtual functions is crucial for designing robust and maintainable object-oriented systems.
