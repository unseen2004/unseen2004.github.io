# Chapter 29: Exceptions

Exceptions provide a way to handle errors or exceptional conditions in a program. They allow you to separate error-handling code from regular code, making your programs easier to read and maintain.

## Basic Syntax

### Throwing and Catching Exceptions

```cpp
try
{
    // Statements that may throw exceptions you want to handle go here
    throw -1; // here's a trivial throw statement
}
catch (int x)
{
    // Handle an exception of type int here
    std::cerr << "We caught an int exception with value " << x << '\n';
}
```

- A `try` block must have at least one `catch` block immediately following it, but may have multiple `catch` blocks listed in sequence.
- No type conversion is done for exceptions (so an int exception will not be converted to match a catch block with a double parameter).
- However, casts from a derived class to one of its parent classes will be performed.

### Catch-All Handler

```cpp
catch (...) // catch-all handler
{
    std::cerr << "We caught an exception of unknown type";
}
```

## Custom Exception Classes

You can create classes primarily used to handle exceptions.

```cpp
class ArrayException
{
private:
    std::string m_error;

public:
    ArrayException(std::string_view error)
        : m_error{ error }
    {
    }

    const std::string& getError() const { return m_error; }
};
```

Handlers for derived exception classes should be listed before those for base classes.

## Standard Library Exceptions

**std::exception** (defined in the `<exception>` header) is a small interface class designed to serve as a base class to any exception thrown by the C++ standard library.

```cpp
catch (const std::exception& exception)
{
    std::cerr << "Standard exception: " << exception.what() << '\n';
}
```

Throwing a standard exception:

```cpp
throw std::runtime_error("Invalid index");
```

## noexcept Specifier

The `noexcept` specifier means the function promises not to throw exceptions itself.

```cpp
void doSomething() noexcept; // this function is specified as non-throwing
```

- Exception objects need to be copyable.
- When rethrowing the same exception, use the `throw` keyword by itself.

## Function Try Blocks

Use function try blocks when you need a constructor to handle an exception thrown in the member initializer list.

```cpp
class B : public A
{
public:
    B(int x) try : A{x} // note addition of try keyword here
    {
    }
    catch (...) // note this is at the same level of indentation as the function itself
    {
        // Exceptions from member initializer list or constructor body are caught here
        std::cerr << "Exception caught\n";
        throw; // rethrow the existing exception
    }
};
```

## Dynamic Memory Management in Try Blocks

Ways to ensure that dynamic memory in try blocks will be deallocated if an error occurs:

1. Create a pointer before the try block.
2. Use `std::unique_ptr`.

```cpp
auto* john { new Person("John", 18, PERSON_MALE) };
std::unique_ptr<Person> upJohn { john }; // upJohn now owns john
```

## Destructors and Exceptions

Destructors should not throw exceptions.

## When to Use Exceptions

Exceptions are best used when all of the following are true:
- The error being handled is likely to occur only infrequently.
- The error is serious and execution could not continue otherwise.
- The error cannot be handled at the place where it occurs.
- There isnâ€™t a good alternative way to return an error code back to the caller.

## noexcept in Function Declarations

```cpp
void doSomething() noexcept; // this function is specified as non-throwing
noexcept(true) // true: not throwing, false: potentially throwing
noexcept(expression) // check if it's potentially throwing
```

- Always make move constructors, move assignment, and swap functions `noexcept`.
- Make copy constructors and copy assignment operators `noexcept` when you can.
- Use `noexcept` on other functions to express a no-fail or no-throw guarantee.

## std::move_if_noexcept

`std::move_if_noexcept` will return a movable r-value if the object has a `noexcept` move constructor, otherwise it will return a copyable l-value.
