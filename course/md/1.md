# Chapter 1: Compiler

## Introduction to Compiler and Interpreter

### Compiler:
- **Characteristics**:
  - Does not need to be installed on other devices.
  - Runs once to produce an executable file.
  - No source code distribution is needed.

- **Process**:
  - High-Level Code → Compiler (translating to machine code/assembly) → Linker → Executable (file)
  - Executable → Hardware → Result

### Interpreter:
- **Characteristics**:
  - Needs to be installed on every device where the code runs.
  - Runs every time the code is executed.

- **Process**:
  - High-Level Code → Interpreter → Hardware → Result

## Options to Run Code

### Build
- **Description**: Compiles all *modified* code files in the project or workspace/solution and then links the object files into an executable. If no code files have been modified since the last build, this option does nothing.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  make build  # Example command (depends on the build system)
  ```

### Clean
- **Description**: Removes all cached objects and executables so the next time the project is built, all files will be recompiled and a new executable produced.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  make clean  # Example command (depends on the build system)
  ```

### Rebuild
- **Description**: Combines the actions of "clean" and "build" to ensure a complete rebuild of the project.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  make rebuild  # Example command (depends on the build system)
  ```

### Compile
- **Description**: Recompiles a single code file regardless of whether it has been cached previously. This option does not invoke the linker or produce an executable.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  g++ -c file.cpp  # Example command for compiling a single file
  ```

### Run/Start
- **Description**: Executes the executable from a prior build. Some IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio) will invoke a "build" before doing a "run" to ensure you are running the latest version of your code.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  ./executable  # Example command to run the executable
  ```

## Additional Information

### Compiler vs Interpreter

**Compiler**:
- Translates the entire program into machine code before execution.
- Faster execution time since the translation is done once.
- Examples: GCC, Clang, MSVC.

**Interpreter**:
- Translates and executes the code line-by-line.
- Slower execution time due to continuous translation.
- Examples: Python interpreter, Ruby interpreter.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a simple example of a C++ program and the steps to compile and run it using GCC:

```cpp
// hello.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Compile and Run:**

1. **Compile**:
    ```sh
    g++ -o hello hello.cpp
    ```
2. **Run**:
    ```sh
    ./hello
    ```
