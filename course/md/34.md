# Chapter 33: Features of Language Versions

## C++11

C++11 introduced numerous features that have significantly enhanced the language. Some of the key features are:

### 1. Move Semantics
- **Move constructors and move assignment operators** allow resources to be moved rather than copied.

### 2. Lambda Expressions
- **Lambda expressions** provide a concise way to define anonymous function objects.

### 3. Smart Pointers
- **`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`** for better memory management.

### 4. Auto Keyword
- **`auto` keyword** for type inference.

### 5. Range-based for Loop
- **Range-based for loop** for easier iteration over collections.

### 6. nullptr
- **`nullptr`** keyword to represent null pointers.

### 7. constexpr
- **`constexpr`** for constant expressions.

### 8. Static_assert
- **`static_assert`** for compile-time assertions.

### 9. Threading
- **Thread support library** including `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`, and `std::unique_lock`.

### 10. Other Features
- **Rvalue references, variadic templates, initializer lists, `std::array`, `std::unordered_map`, and `std::unordered_set`**.

## C++14

C++14 introduced several improvements and refinements to C++11 features:

### 1. Generic Lambdas
- **Generic lambdas** allow lambdas to accept parameters of different types.

### 2. Return Type Deduction
- **Return type deduction** for normal functions using `auto`.

### 3. Variable Templates
- **Variable templates** for defining templates for variables.

### 4. Relaxed constexpr
- **Relaxed constraints on `constexpr`** functions, allowing more complex expressions.

### 5. Other Enhancements
- **`std::make_unique`, binary literals, digit separators, and deprecated attribute**.

## C++17

C++17 introduced several new features and enhancements:

### 1. std::optional
- **`std::optional`** for optional values.

### 2. std::variant and std::any
- **`std::variant` and `std::any`** for type-safe unions and type-erased containers.

### 3. Structured Bindings
- **Structured bindings** for unpacking tuples and other types.

### 4. if constexpr
- **`if constexpr`** for compile-time conditions.

### 5. std::string_view
- **`std::string_view`** for non-owning views of strings.

### 6. Parallel Algorithms
- **Parallel versions of standard algorithms**.

### 7. Filesystem Library
- **Filesystem library** for file and directory operations.

### 8. Other Features
- **Nested namespaces, `std::byte`, and `std::scoped_lock`**.

## C++20

C++20 introduced major new features and improvements:

### 1. Concepts
- **Concepts** for constraining template parameters.

### 2. Ranges
- **Ranges library** for working with sequences.

### 3. Coroutines
- **Coroutines** for asynchronous programming.

### 4. Modules
- **Modules** for better code organization and faster compilation.

### 5. Three-way Comparison
- **Three-way comparison operator (`<=>`)** for spaceship operator.

### 6. Calendar and Time Zone Library
- **Calendar and time zone library** for date and time operations.

### 7. Expanded constexpr
- **Expanded `constexpr`** capabilities.

### 8. Other Enhancements
- **Improved `constexpr` lambdas, `std::format`, and `std::span`**.

## C++23

C++23 introduced further improvements and new features:

### 1. Pattern Matching
- **Pattern matching** for more expressive code.

### 2. Standard Library Improvements
- **Enhanced standard library components**.

### 3. More Powerful Lambdas
- **Lambdas with more powerful capabilities**.

### 4. Other Enhancements
- **Refinements and optimizations to existing features**.

## C++26 (Upcoming)

C++26 is expected to introduce new features and enhancements. Some of the anticipated features are:

### 1. Enhanced Modules
- Further improvements to the **modules** feature.

### 2. Improved Coroutines
- Enhancements and optimizations to the **coroutines** feature.

### 3. Advanced Pattern Matching
- More powerful **pattern matching** capabilities.

### 4. Reflection
- **Reflection** capabilities for introspection.

### 5. Other Enhancements
- Additional improvements and optimizations to existing features.
