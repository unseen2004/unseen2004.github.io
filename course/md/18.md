# Chapter 18: Enums and Structs

## Program-Defined Types

- Enumerated types (including unscoped and scoped enumerations)
- Class types (including structs, classes, and unions).

A program-defined type used in only one code file should be defined in that code file as close to the first point of use as possible. A program-defined type used in multiple code files should be defined in a header file with the same name as the program-defined type and then #included into each code file as needed.

## Enumerations

Enumerations are types that restrict values to a set of named symbolic constants (called enumerators).

### Unscoped Enumerations

```cpp
enum Color
{
    red,         // 0
    green,       // 1
    yellow = -3, // -3
    blue,        // trailing comma optional but recommended
}; // the enum definition must end with a semicolon

enum Animal
{
    cat = -3,    // values can be negative
    dog,         // -2
    pig,         // -1
    horse = 5,
    giraffe = 5, // shares same value as horse
    chicken,     // 6
};

Color apple { red };
Color raspberry { Color::red }; // accessing enumerator from scope of Color

Animal a {}; // value-initialization zero-initializes a to value 0

if (shirt == blue) // if the shirt is blue
    std::cout << "Your shirt is blue!";
```

### Scoped Enumerations / Enum Class

```cpp
enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enumeration rather than an unscoped enumeration
{
    red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
};

enum class Fruit
{
    banana, // banana is considered part of Fruit's scope region
};

Color color { Color::red };    // note: red is not directly accessible, we have to use Color::red
Fruit fruit { Fruit::banana };

if (color == fruit) // compile error: the compiler doesn't know how to compare different types Color and Fruit
    std::cout << "color and fruit are equal\n";

std::cout << static_cast<int>(color) << '\n';   // explicit conversion to int, will print 1
```

### Using Enumerations

```cpp
#include <optional> // for std::optional

enum Pet
{
    cat,   // 0
    dog,   // 1
};

constexpr std::optional<Pet> getPetFromString(std::string_view sv)
{
    if (sv == "cat")   return cat;
    if (sv == "dog")   return dog;
    return {};
}    

std::optional<Pet> pet { getPetFromString(s) };

if (!pet)
    std::cout << "You entered an Invalid pet\n";
```

### Scoped Enumerators Int Conversion

```cpp
#include <type_traits> // for std::underlying_type_t
constexpr auto operator+(Animals a) constexpr
{
    return static_cast<std::underlying_type_t<Animals>>(a);
}
std::cout << +Animals::elephant << '\n'; // convert Animals::elephant to an integer using unary operator
```

## Structs

Structs are user-defined types that group variables of different types together.

### Basic Struct

```cpp
struct Employee
{
    int id;            // no value-initialized, bad
    int age {};        // value-initialized by default, 0 
    double wage {232}; // explicit default value
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& employee) // note pass by reference here
{
    std::cout << "ID:   " << employee.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "Age:  " << employee.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "Wage: " << employee.wage << '\n';
}

Employee joe {};
joe.age = 32;  // use member selection operator (.) to select the age member of variable joe

Employee frank = { 1, 32, 60000.0 }; // copy-list initialization using braced list
Employee joe { 2, 28, 45000.0 };     // list initialization using braced list (preferred)
Employee joe { 2, 28 }; // joe.wage will be value-initialized to 0.0
Employee joe {}; // value-initialize all members

printEmployee(Employee { 14, 32, 24.15 }); // construct a temporary Employee to pass to function (type explicitly specified) (preferred)
printEmployee({ 15, 28, 18.27 });          // construct a temporary Employee to pass to function (type deduced from parameter)
```

### Nested Struct

```cpp
struct Company
{
    struct Employee // accessed via Company::Employee
    {
        int id{};
        int age{};
        double wage{};
    };

    int numberOfEmployees{};
    Employee CEO{}; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
};

Company myCompany{ 7, { 1, 32, 55000.0 } }; // Nested initialization list to initialize Employee
myCompany.CEO.wage;
```

### Returning Structs

```cpp
struct Point3d
{
    double x { 0.0 };
    double y { 0.0 };
    double z { 0.0 };
};

Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    return Point3d { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // return an unnamed Point3d
}

Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    return { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // return an unnamed Point3d
}
```

### Struct Size and Padding

The size of a struct will be at least as large as the size of all the variables it contains. You can minimize padding by defining your members in decreasing order of size.

```cpp
struct Foo1
{
    short a{}; // will have 2 bytes of padding after a
    int b{};
    short c{}; // will have 2 bytes of padding after c
};

struct Foo2
{
    int b{};
    short a{};
    short c{};
};

sizeof(Foo1); // 12
sizeof(Foo2); // 8
```
