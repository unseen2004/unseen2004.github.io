# Chapter 32: STL Introduction

## What is STL?

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful library in C++ that provides a set of common classes and functions for data structures and algorithms. It includes:

- Containers: Data structures like vectors, lists, and sets.
- Iterators: Objects used to traverse elements in containers.
- Algorithms: Functions for operations like searching, sorting, and manipulating data.

## Components of STL

### 1. Containers

Containers are data structures that store collections of objects. The main types of containers in STL are:

- **Sequence Containers**: Maintain the order of elements.
  - `vector`: Dynamic array.
  - `deque`: Double-ended queue.
  - `list`: Doubly linked list.
- **Associative Containers**: Store elements in a specific order.
  - `set`: Collection of unique keys, sorted by keys.
  - `map`: Collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys.
  - `multiset`: Collection of keys, allowing duplicates, sorted by keys.
  - `multimap`: Collection of key-value pairs, allowing duplicates, sorted by keys.
- **Unordered Containers**: Store elements in no particular order.
  - `unordered_set`: Collection of unique keys, hashed by keys.
  - `unordered_map`: Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys.
  - `unordered_multiset`: Collection of keys, allowing duplicates, hashed by keys.
  - `unordered_multimap`: Collection of key-value pairs, allowing duplicates, hashed by keys.

### 2. Iterators

Iterators are objects that point to elements in containers. They provide a way to access and traverse elements in containers.

- **Input Iterators**: Read-only access to a sequence.
- **Output Iterators**: Write-only access to a sequence.
- **Forward Iterators**: Read and write access, can move forward.
- **Bidirectional Iterators**: Read and write access, can move forward and backward.
- **Random Access Iterators**: Read and write access, can move in any direction.

### 3. Algorithms

Algorithms are functions that perform operations on containers. They are implemented as template functions and work with iterators.

- **Non-modifying Algorithms**: Do not change the elements in the container.
  - `find`, `count`, `equal`, `mismatch`
- **Modifying Algorithms**: Change the elements in the container.
  - `copy`, `swap`, `replace`, `fill`
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Sort and search elements in the container.
  - `sort`, `binary_search`, `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`
- **Numeric Algorithms**: Perform numeric operations.
  - `accumulate`, `inner_product`, `partial_sum`

## Example Usage

### Using a Vector Container

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Display elements
    for (int val : vec)
    {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Sort elements in descending order
    std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::greater<int>());

    // Display sorted elements
    for (int val : vec)
    {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Using an Iterator

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Use an iterator to traverse the vector
    for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it)
    {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Using an Algorithm

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Find an element
    auto it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3);
    if (it != vec.end())
    {
        std::cout << "Element found: " << *it << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Element not found" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

The STL is a powerful tool in C++ that provides a wide range of functionalities for managing data structures and algorithms. Understanding and utilizing STL components can greatly enhance your programming efficiency and effectiveness.
