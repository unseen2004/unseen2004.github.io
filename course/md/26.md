# Chapter 26: Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (members and functions) from another class (base class).

## Basic Syntax

```cpp
class BaseballPlayer : public Person
```

- **Protected members** can be accessed by members, friends, and derived classes.

## Inheritance Types

The default inheritance type is private.

| **Access specifier in base class** | **Access specifier when inherited publicly** | **Access specifier when inherited privately** | **Access specifier when inherited protectedly** |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Public                             | Public                                       | Private                                       | Protected                                      |
| Protected                          | Protected                                    | Private                                       | Protected                                      |
| Private                            | Inaccessible                                 | Inaccessible                                  | Inaccessible                                   |

### Example

```cpp
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    int getValue() const = delete; // mark this function as inaccessible
    using Base::print; 
    // make all Base::print() functions eligible for overload resolution
    // By that you can change access specifier e.g. print could be protected in Base but now it's public
    // you can't change from private because Derived class has no access to private Base members
};
```

### Accessing Base Class Functions

```cpp
Derived derived;

// We can call the Base::getValue() function directly
std::cout << derived.Base::getValue();

// Or we can upcast Derived to a Base reference and getValue() will resolve to Base::getValue()
std::cout << static_cast<Base&>(derived).getValue();
```

## Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.

### Example

```cpp
class Teacher : public Person, public Employee

// Specify which function to use in case of ambiguity
c54G.USBDevice::getID();
```

Avoid multiple inheritance unless alternatives lead to more complexity.

## Constructor Initialization in Derived Classes

When a derived class is instantiated, the base class constructor is called first.

### Example

```cpp
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    Derived()
        : Base(params...) // call base constructor
    {
        // derived class constructor body
    }
};
```

## Conclusion

Inheritance allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical class structure. Understanding how to use different types of inheritance and manage access to base class members is crucial for designing robust and maintainable object-oriented systems.
